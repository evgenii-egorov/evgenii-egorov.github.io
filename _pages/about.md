I am working in the field of machine learning in the [AMLab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl), University of Amsterdam. My supervisiors are Max Welling and Roberto Bondesan. I did a bit in the interplay between deep generative models and MCMC methods. My current research is focused on Quantum Error Correction. Iâ€™m interested in the following research areas and methods:

- Quantum Error Correction
- QFT on lattice
- Geometric measure theory
- MCMC, PDE and Symmetries


See my [publications](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=LwVVunEAAAAJ). I am happy to collaborate or give a talk. 


Also, I did applied/research projects for Huawei and other large companies, including 5G simulation and petrol related PDE solving.
I can do this for your company too!
